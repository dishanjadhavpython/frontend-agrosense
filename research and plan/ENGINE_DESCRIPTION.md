Regur is a crop and fertiliser recommendation engine for Maharashtra, built on Soil Health Card data, taluka-level agro-climatology, and eight years of district crop statistics. Given a taluka and season, it returns a ranked shortlist of viable crops, a yield outlook (below/typical/above norm with a p10-p50-p90 band), an exact fertiliser dose interpolated to the soil test, a nitrogen split schedule, and micronutrient corrections the government table omits.

The design rejects a single end-to-end model in favour of five stages, each using the technique that actually fits it: a LightGBM LambdaMART ranker (learning-to-rank, since there is no single correct crop, only a shortlist of viable ones); a rules-based agronomic gate applying FAO EcoCrop/ICAR envelopes through Liebig's law of the minimum, needing zero labels; LightGBM quantile regression for yield, trained on within-crop z-scores rather than raw yield; an exact lookup engine for fertiliser dosing, since the government table has zero ambiguous keys across 33,169 rows and a model could only add error; and a calibration layer combining split-conformal intervals with a Mahalanobis out-of-distribution guard that abstains rather than guesses.

The project's founding insight: a model predicting raw yield from soil and weather scored R² = 0.93, but a model given only the crop name scored 0.91 — it had learned crop-scale arithmetic, not agronomy. The honest within-crop signal is R² = 0.19, and every downstream design choice is sized for that reality rather than a flattering headline number.

Everything is validated under GroupKFold by district, never a random split. The full engine reaches NDCG@5 = 0.883 against a popularity baseline of 0.740, and conformal intervals hit their nominal coverage almost exactly (90.1% for a stated 90%).

Built in Python 3.13 with LightGBM, scikit-learn, scipy, pandas, and served via FastAPI with a hand-built SVG console, backed by 178 tests and full reproducibility from raw data to report.
